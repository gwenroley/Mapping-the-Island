           <p>Stéphanie’s family has lived in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, on the same floor, in the same building for her entire life. When her parents immigrated to Montreal over 35 years ago, they rented an apartment in a building in La Petite-Patrie. Her aunt, uncle and grandmother followed, all renting units in the same building. Stéphanie and her sisters grew up with her cousins just down the hall and as they got older and the younger generation started to move back and forth from the building to go to college and university, the apartments became communal within the family as different households moved and shared in different units. Stéphanie began sharing one of the apartments with her boyfriend and her mother and aunt got to spend nearly every day together as they watched their families grow up.</p> 
           <p>But after three decades of calling the building on rue St-Zotique home, they’re being forced to leave.</p>
           <p>“Since they immigrated from Vietnam, they’ve never lived in any other neighbourhood, so they already know all the neighbours,” Stéphanie said. “When we go to Little Italy (a neighbourhood in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie), they know the barber, they know the grocery man and everything, so it will be very heartbreaking for us to move from this area.”</p>

           <p>The building has gone through a number of owners, since the family first moved in in 1984. But, after a construction company bought the building in 2021, they offered Stéphanie’s family compensation for them to move out so they could renovate and expand. She didn’t want to specify the price, but said it wouldn’t be enough to cover a year’s worth of rent while staying in La Petite-Patrie.</p>
           <p>At first, she said the company tried to be empathetic about the trade to move for compensation, but as the family continued to decline, they became more persistent. Stéphanie knew their rent was low for the neighbourhood, one of the units, a 4 ½, was rented for under $700 a month. She said she thought this contributed to why the construction company wanted them to leave, so they could raise the price of rent in their units.</p>
           <p>When they were first informed about the new owner’s plans, Stéphanie and her family Initially wanted to fight to stay in the building that had been their home since they came to Montreal. But that has changed over the past months.</p>
           <p>“At the end of the day, I think that my parents, my aunt and my uncle—who is over 60 years old—don’t have the strength to go to the court and then maybe go back. So, we decided to take the compensation and move Oct. 1, 2021.”</p>
           <p>Mélanie Baril, a community organizer for the Comité logement de la Petite Patrie (CLPP), said in her work advocating for housing rights in the borough, Stephanie’s family’s case is one she she’s often. She said that in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie she is seeing more and more cases where long-time residents with lower-to-middle class income levels are being asked to leave their apartments, usually because building owners say they want to renovate. However, she said since most of these residents have been in their apartments for so long, most have been paying much lower rents compared to what they might find on the rental market today.</p>
           <p>“What we are seeing a lot of in La-Petite-Patrie is this split between the social classes,” Baril said. “Between those who are more wealthy and those who are at risk of being displaced from the neighbourhood.”</p>
           <p>The average rent in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie has increased steadily over the past years. It is by no means the most expensive neighbourhood to live in Montreal, but between 2015 and 2019, the average monthly price of an apartment of any size increased $99, going from $666 per month in 2015 to $765 per month in 2019, according to the yearly surveys produced by the <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-data/data-tables/rental-market/centre-level-data-tables">Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation</a> (CMHC). In 2019, it estimated rent to be $790 per month for a 4 ½-room unit.</p>
           <p>This rental average for each year is calculated using the average rental prices of apartments ranging in size from studios to five-and-a-halfs. The CMHC bases its figures on data collected through randomized telephone surveys during which they ask property owners questions about what they charge for rent and the vacancy rates in their buildings.</p>
           <p>The Regroupement des comités logement et associations de locataires du Québec (RCLALQ) performed a <a href="https://rclalq.qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/La-flamb%C3%A9e-des-loyersVF.pdf">study</a> last year by scraping ads for rental properties on the Canadian online classifieds site Kijiji. It calculated the average advertised monthly price for an apartment of any size in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie in 2020 to be $1,184 per month and for a 4 ½-room unit it was $1,260 per month. The discrepancy in the CMHC and RCLALQ’s prices can be attributed to the different ways in which the data was collected. But, the CMHC data still shows the rent in Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie has been increasing, and advocates at both RCLALQ and CLPP say that this rise is showing no signs of stopping.</p>

            <p>Baril noted she has also seen a trend of long-time tenants leaving the neighbourhood. She said that when apartments change hands, it is easier for landlords to raise rent (as new tenants don’t usually know the previous rent) so higher-income renters come into the neighbourhood, but then have to deal with neglectful landlords.</p>
            <p>Thomas has lived in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie for three years now and said that he has trouble getting in contact with the company that manages his building whenever he has a maintenance issue. He said he never even received the main number for the company and only had the emergency hotline contact number and this meant, in his experience, it took longer than expected for problems to get fixed.</p>
            <p>Thomas called Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie a very mixed neighbourhood, noting that there buildings that might be in disrepair, and then a few blocks away there will be new buildings for architecture firms and notaries. He sees this as signs of a changing neighbourhood where people are trying to build new, more expensive buildings. </p>
            <p>“What I find sad is when families have to change neighbourhoods to be able to afford an apartment,” he said.</p>
            <p>Stéphanie said she and her family knew they were paying less than other tenants in the building, as their long-term tenancy prevented the landlord’s from raising their rent more than the standard. J-C, said he lived through a very similar situation this past year, when his landlord tried to take back his apartment that he had been living in for 10 years and he had to request an audience with Tribunal administratif du Logement (TAL) to contest the action.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>“Even though I was pretty sure I was going to win my case with the TAL and I would be able to stay, I had begun looking for other apartments,” he said.</p>
            <p>J-C said he found out his landlord was going to try and take back the apartment as a dwelling for one of his children, when he was receiving maintenance work on a plumbing issue in his building that left his toilet non-functional for a whole day. The TAL sided with J-C in his case because the original notice said the apartment was going to be taken back in August, one month after his lease renewal this July of this year. He said he was happy to be staying, but the experience of having to take his landlord to the TAL has made their relationship uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>Baril, who lives in neighbouring Parc-Extension, said she has observed changes in the neighbourhood over the past 20 years. She said that while it has always been a generally middle-class area, there were still spots that were traditionally low-income, like the Secteur Marconi-Alexandra. It has gone from being one of the poorest areas in Montreal to now being one of the richest.</p>
            <p>“La Petite-Patrie has seen a very fast gentrification,” Baril said. “That is to say, today, the price of housing is very similar to that of Plateau-Mont-Royal, for example, where the price of housing has been rising for a long time.”</p>
            <p>Baril said that the solution to a housing crisis is not just social housing, because social housing is not supposed to be for the middle-class. From what she sees at the CLPP, middle-class renters are not able to afford apartments in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie anymore. The solution she sees to keep housing affordable without pushing people out, and that is supported by the RCLALQ, is a government-instituted control on rents with a rental price registry, as well as a control on real estate prices. Baril said this would prevent rents from increasing at the rate they now and discourage people from buying up property in a way that makes housing less accessible to people who can’t afford to buy a duplex or a triplex.</p>
            <p>“This will take control measures before, during and after [rent increases] to make these situations easier for all parties and recalibrate the situation,” Baril said.</p>
            <p>Stéphanie and her family will be leaving their building on October 1, and they will all be moving to different parts of the city, she said, because the rent in Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie is too high compared to what they are used to paying. She said the most difficult part will be living apart after having all been in the same building for so long.</p>
            <p>“We tried hard to find something next to each other, but it seemed impossible.”</p>
