        <p>The face of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is changing. That is what Odélie Joly, a community organizer at the Comité Bails Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, has to say about the neighbourhood her organization performs its assistance in. The Comité Bails Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is a collection of citizens that works to defend the rights of poorly housed people and to procure social housing for people who need it. Joly has worked with the comité since 2007 and said that during that time she has seen new types of businesses move in that has attracted a richer demographic of renters to the neighbourhood.</p>
        <p>“It’s not that people in the neighbourhood are getting richer,” Joly said. “It’s that the poor people in the neighbourhood have moved.”</p>
        <p>She said as wealthier people have moved in, the social services which have traditionally been used by people in the neighbourhood have dwindled. The example she used was school breakfast programs, the need for which is determined by the income bracket of the families in a school’s district, and since those income brackets have been going up, she has seen many of those breakfast programs eliminated.</p>
        <p>“And I’m not talking about very, very rich people, it’s really middle class, upper middle class people,” she said. “Now that the price of housing and condos is rising, it’s sure that we will be getting more rich people here.”</p>
        <p>Between 2015 and 2019, the average monthly rent in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve rose 9.16 percent, from $684 per month in 2015 to $753 per month in 2019, according to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation.</p>
        <p>As is the case across the city of Montreal, on July 1, 2021 the neighbourhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve was shaken up by the traditional day when leases expire and renters changing apartments move their belongings. Below follows a series of photos from the neighbourhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve on moving day.</p>
