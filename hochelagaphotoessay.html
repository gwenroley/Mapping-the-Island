        <p>The face of Montreal’s Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough is changing. That is what Odélie Joly, a community organizer at the Comité Bails Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, has to say about the neighbourhood her housing advocacy organization serves. The Comité Bails Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is a collection of citizens that works to defend the rights of those in precarious housing situations and to put pressure on the government to increase the amount of social housing in the city. Joly has worked with the group since 2007 and said that over the past 14 years she has seen new types of businesses move in that have attracted a richer demographic of renters to the neighbourhood.</p>
        <p>“It’s not that people in the neighbourhood are getting richer,” Joly said. “It’s that the poor people in the neighbourhood have moved.”</p>
        <p>She said as wealthier people have moved in, the social services traditionally used by people in the neighbourhood have dwindled. The example she used was school breakfast programs, the need for which is determined by the income bracket of the families in a school’s district. Since the neighbourhood’s income brackets have been going up, she has seen many of those breakfast programs eliminated.</p>
        <p>“And I’m not talking about very, very rich people. It’s really middle-class, upper-middle-class people,” she said. “Now that the price of housing and condos is rising, it’s sure that we will be getting more rich people here.”</p>
        <p>Between 2015 and 2019, the average monthly rent in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve rose 9.16 per cent, from $684 per month in 2015 to $753 per month in 2019, according to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).</p>
        <p>As is the case across the province of Quebec every year, on July 1, 2021 was shaken up by “Moving Day,” the day most annual leases in Quebec expire and many people change apartments. Below follows a series of photos taken in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve on moving day this year.</p>
